# Tip Calculator Project

# Make a python script  tip_calculator.py that takes a user's input at the command line for:

# Cost of the food
# Number of people splitting the bill
#  Percentage of the tip
# Hint: you might want to use the input() function for taking user input

# Then, the script should output:

# The total bill (including tip)
# how much each person should pay (you can assume all people will split the bill evenly)
# Assume there is a 10% sales tax. Don't forget to add this into the total bill! 

# Note: your tip calculator should be able to handle a bill of any amount 
# of many money, with any number of people splitting the bill, and with any tip percentage (including 0 tip)

# First ask for the total cost or the meal?
# Second ask for the tip in %?
# Third ask how many adults
# Last the calculator will let you know how much each person have to pay.
